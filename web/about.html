            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Vinay S N, an Electronics and Communication Engineering student with a passion for innovative technologies and impactful projects.
            </p>
            <p>
                I aim to continuously grow, learn, and make meaningful contributions to the tech community.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have completed three projects. The first is a line-following robot, the second is a sound-sensing LED system, and the Colour Changing LED.

                Moving to the software side, you can see this website, which I built using CSS and HTML.
